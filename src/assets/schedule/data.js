      speaker: "beerops",
      description: "Devops originally started as a way of enabling both developers and operations engineers to work better together, but over the years since its inception it's become much more than that. The principles of devops can be beneficial to everyone involved in creating software solutions, not just two teams. This talk will discuss practical ideas for how the four pillars of effective devops can be used throughout an organization, and the benefits of spreading operational thinking further than just the ops team."

      description: "The DevOps movement has changed the way we build applications and infrastructure. It's also allowed us to scale larger than ever before. But along with larger scale comes increased complexity and more risk of failure. It's impossible to avoid failure, but the key to operating successfully at scale comes from how quickly you can detect failure, respond to it, resolve it and ultimately learn from it."

In this talk, we'll discuss some of these patterns from systems I've worked on at Google and the related work that provide insights into the motivations behind them."

      description: "Internet has evolved in different and sometimes unexpected ways since its inception. Also, we have seen changes in the infrastructure that supports the web and how we use it, from static data centers, to cloud computing and decentralized systems. Distributed computing, on the other hand, is often associated with academy or research projects, with low potential to be used on production. However, the raise of distributed systems like BitTorrent, Git and Bitcoin is opening a new path for *real* distributed computing for everyone. "

      description: "In the real world it is a luxury to be able start configuration management of services from scratch. Much more difficult, and unfortunately much more common, is the need to turn existing production environments from 'pets' to 'cattle'. Because 'pets' are by definition harder to predict and cannot be easily duplicated, changing them into cattle can be quite challenging and a resource hog."

      speaker: "armon",
      description: "Most startups are in a race, either against competitors or burn rates to deliver products. This demands an increased focus on agility of delivery, which is a perfect fit for DevOps. In this talk, we discuss what DevOps is, and how it affects the people, processes, and tools used to deliver an app. Specifically, we discuss DevOps as a process for delivering software, and optimizing for agility instead of risk. DevOps applies to startups as well as Fortune 500's, and we will cover some pragmatic ways to get started and add value without getting caught up with all the shiny new tools."
