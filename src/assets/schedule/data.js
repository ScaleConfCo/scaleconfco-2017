En este espacio de una hora y media hablaremos sobre qué es Terraform, para qué casos aplica mejor, casos de uso comunes y pondremos en práctica la teoría básica de Terraform para crear múltiples ambientes en Google Cloud. Es necesario tener experiencia en Unix y entendimiento básico de tecnologías PaaS como AWS, Digital Ocean, Linode y/o Google Cloud."

This demands an increased focus on agility of delivery, which is a perfect fit for DevOps. In this talk, we discuss what DevOps is, and how it affects the people, processes, and tools used to deliver an app. Specifically, we discuss DevOps as a process for delivering software, and optimizing for agility instead of risk. DevOps applies to startups as well as Fortune 500's, and we will cover some pragmatic ways to get started and add value without getting caught up with all the shiny new tools."

But along with larger scale comes increased complexity and more risk of failure. It's impossible to avoid failure, but the key to operating successfully at scale comes from how quickly you can detect failure, respond to it, resolve it and ultimately learn from it."

Also, we have seen changes in the infrastructure that supports the web and how we use it, from static data centers, to cloud computing and decentralized systems. Distributed computing, on the other hand, is often associated with academy or research projects, with low potential to be used on production. However, the raise of distributed systems like BitTorrent, Git and Bitcoin is opening a new path for *real* distributed computing for everyone."
