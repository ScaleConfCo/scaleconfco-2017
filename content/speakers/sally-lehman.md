Sally grew up in various small towns in the northwestern United States, and is now semi-nomadic, spending time in recently in California, Arizona, and Tennessee. Her first computer experiences were with EMACs, MS-DOS, and Ski Free when she was < 5 years old, and people have been trying to get her off her computer, with limited success, ever since. She has a wonderful husband named Brandon, a tiny Italian Greyhound named Sudo, and is an Olympic Weightlifting competitor. At Auth0, She is a Production Engineer, who focuses on monitoring and availability as well as config management for highly scalable and available infrastructure. Sally's favorite movie is Office Space and she makes a mean Tiramisu.
