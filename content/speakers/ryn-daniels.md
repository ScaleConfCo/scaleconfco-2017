Ryn Daniels is a senior operations engineer at Etsy and is a semi-regular blogger as well as coauthor of O'Reilly Media's Effective DevOps. They got their start in programming with TI-80 calculators back when GeoCities was still cool. These days, they have opinions on things like "the cloud" and "devops". Before escaping to the world of operations, they spent a few years doing R&D and systems engineering in the corporate world. Ryn lives in Brooklyn with a perfectly reasonable number of cats and in their spare time can often be found lifting heavy things or handcrafting knitted server koozies for the data center.
